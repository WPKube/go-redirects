A super-simple URL forwarder for WordPress.

== Description ==

Go Redirects is a URL forwarder plugin for WordPress that enables URLs like `http://mysite.com/go/far-far-away/` to forward to URLs like `http://someothersite.com/`. It's a great way to create clean-looking affiliate links or provide permement links for remote URLs that may change over time. It includes analytics for the number of times a URL has been forwarded.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and activate the plugin.
2. Go to **Settings** → **Permalinks** and resave your permalink settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the redirects base URL slug from `/go/` to something else? =

There is no setting to do so at this time. It is called Go Redirects after all. :)
